    "action": "Visit a doctor to discuss treatment options. Pituitary tumors can affect hormone levels and require medical attention.",
    "origin": "Arise from the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain responsible for hormone production.",
    "description": """
        The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. 
        It is responsible for producing and releasing hormones that regulate a wide range 
        of bodily functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction.
        
        Pituitary tumors are growths that develop in the pituitary gland. They can be benign
         (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). 
        Benign pituitary tumors are more common than malignant pituitary tumors.

        Pituitary tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on their size 
        and location. Common symptoms include:
        - Headaches
        - Vision problems
        - Double vision
        - Blurred vision
        - Loss of peripheral vision
        - Nausea and vomiting
        - Fatigue
        - Weight gain
        - Increased thirst
        - Frequent urination
        - Menstrual irregularities
        - Infertility
        - Erectile dysfunction
        
        Pituitary tumors are diagnosed with a combination of physical 
        examination, blood tests, and imaging tests. Blood tests can
         be used to measure the levels of hormones produced by the pituitary 
         gland. Imaging tests, such as MRI and CT scans, can be used to 
         visualize the pituitary gland and to identify any tumors.

        Treatment for pituitary tumors depends on the size, location, and
         type of tumor. Treatment options include:
        - Surgery
        - Radiation therapy
        - Medication
        - Observation

        Surgery is the primary treatment for pituitary tumors. The goal of 
        surgery is to remove the tumor while preserving the function of the
         pituitary gland. Surgery is typically performed through the nose
          or through a small incision in the forehead.

        Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to
         kill tumor cells. It can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor
          or after surgery to kill any remaining tumor cells.

        Medication: Medication can be used to treat pituitary tumors that
         are not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy. Medications can
          be used to lower hormone levels, shrink the tumor, or relieve symptoms.

        Observation: Observation is an option for patients with small,
         slow-growing pituitary tumors that are not causing any symptoms.
          Patients who are observed will have regular blood tests and imaging 
          tests to monitor the tumor.

        Prognosis: The prognosis for pituitary tumors depends on the size, location,
         and type of tumor, as well as the patient's age and overall health.
          The five-year survival rate for patients with pituitary tumors is about 95%.

  "Glioma": {
    "emergency_level": "High",
    "action": "Seek immediate medical consultation and treatment options, as gliomas are often aggressive and require prompt attention.",
    "origin": "Gliomas arise from glial cells, which support and protect neurons in the brain and spinal cord.",
    "description": """
        Gliomas are tumors that arise from the glial cells in the brain or spinal cord. They are the most common type of brain tumor, accounting for about 80% of all brain tumor cases. Gliomas can be classified into different grades based on their aggressiveness, ranging from grade I (least aggressive) to grade IV (most aggressive).

        Symptoms of gliomas can vary depending on the location and size of the tumor.
         Common symptoms include:
        - Headaches
        - Seizures
        - Nausea and vomiting
        - Vision or hearing problems
        - Weakness or numbness
        - Memory problems
        - Personality changes

        Gliomas are diagnosed through physical examinations, imaging tests like MRI 
        or CT scans, and biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the grade of
         the tumor.

        Treatment for gliomas includes:
        - Surgery: Removing as much of the tumor as possible while preserving 
        healthy tissue.
        - Radiation therapy: High-energy radiation to kill tumor cells.
        - Chemotherapy: Drugs to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing.

        Prognosis varies depending on the tumor's grade. Lower-grade gliomas 
        have a better prognosis with treatment, but higher-grade gliomas,
        particularly grade IV gliomas (glioblastomas), have a poor 
        prognosis with a survival rate lower than 5% for five years.

        Gliomas require close monitoring and aggressive treatment, especially
        for high-grade types, to manage symptoms and improve the patient's 
        quality of life.

  "Meningioma": {

    "origin": "Meningiomas arise from the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.",
    "description": """
        Meningiomas are typically benign tumors that form in the meninges, which are the protective layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They are the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for about 30% of all brain tumors. Meningiomas can grow slowly and often don't cause symptoms right away.

        Symptoms of meningiomas can vary based on their size and location.
         Common symptoms include:
        - Headaches
        - Seizures
        - Vision problems
        - Hearing issues
        - Weakness or numbness
        - Balance problems

        Diagnosis of meningiomas is usually through imaging tests like MRI 
        and CT scans, followed by biopsy to confirm the nature of the tumor.

        Treatment options for meningiomas include:
        - Surgery: Removing the tumor, especially if it is causing symptoms.
        - Radiation therapy: Used for inoperable or recurrent meningiomas to 
          shrink the tumor.
        - Observation: If the tumor is small and not causing significant
         symptoms, doctors may opt for regular monitoring rather than immediate
          intervention.

        Most meningiomas are benign and can be successfully treated with surgery.
         The prognosis is excellent for patients who undergo surgical treatment,
          with many achieving full recovery. However, for malignant meningiomas,
           the prognosis depends on the extent of tumor removal and other factors
            like age and overall health.
